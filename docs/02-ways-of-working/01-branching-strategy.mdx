## Branches

Conventional commits should be used as well to name branches.

## Commits

The commit message should follow a specific format defined by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Pull Requests

The title must follow the Conventional Commits described in the [Commits](#commits) section, with two additions:

- The ticket number before the title
- The Pull Request number

So, the final format should be like this one:

    type(scope): [XXX-123456] title of the ticket

Which is compose with the following elements:

- Type: "feat", "fix" are the most common, the full list is in the [Commits](#commits) section.
- Scope: described in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Ticket number: [XXX-XXXXXX]
