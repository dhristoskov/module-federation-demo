## Local environment

The only requirement is Node.js v18.12.1 or higher.

There are different ways to install it:

- Download it from [their website](https://nodejs.org/)
- Use [nvm, Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Use [asdf, another version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), in this case it's not just for Node.

It's recommended to use a version manager, so the Node version can be easily changed.

## Install

Clone the repository:

    git clone  https://github.com/dhristoskov/phoenix-project

Install dependencies:

    npm install

## Run

Run the project on your local:

    npm start

The web app will connect to the backend, make sure it's running on port 3000
